# etch-a-sketch
Welcome to my Etch-A-Sketch web application! This interactive webpage is a digital version of the classic drawing toy, allowing you to create pixelated masterpieces. The grid consists of 16x16 square divs, each of which changes color as your mouse hovers over them, leaving a pixelated trail reminiscent of a pen. To customize your drawing experience, a "New Grid" button is located at the top of the screen. Clicking this button prompts a popup where you can enter the desired number of squares per side for the new grid. Upon submission, the existing grid is cleared, and a new one is generated within the same total space (e.g., 960px wide), providing you with a fresh canvas for your creative expressions. Dive into the nostalgia of the Etch-A-Sketch experience, now in the digital realm!
